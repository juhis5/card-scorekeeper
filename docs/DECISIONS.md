# Decisions log — autonomous build

One line per decision made without the human (asleep during the overnight build). Format:
`YYYY-MM-DD — decision — rationale`. `docs/PLAN.md` "Decisions locked" wins over anything here.

- 2026-07-23 — Backlog split into 8 vertical slices (domain → repo/store → core UI offline →
  Firestore+rules+e2e → PWA → stats → optional photo → polish). — Dependency-ordered per
  BUILDER_PROMPT (domain lib → stores/adapters → core UI → serverless/rules → offline/pwa →
  stats → polish); each slice independently shippable + testable.
- 2026-07-23 — Core UI (slice 3) built offline-first against LocalGameRepository before the
  Firestore path (slice 4). — The GameRepository seam makes online a swap, not a rewrite; a
  playable local game is the lowest-risk way to validate the domain + UI before adding network.
